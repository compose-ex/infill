# Infill

A simple app to create fake time series in InfluxDB

Imagine there's a building with 8 rooms per level and ten levels...

Now imagine there's a temperature sensor in each room which reports every minute.

Now image that you record (or generate) a months worth of this data and store it in InfluxDB.

That's what Infill does. Around 3.5 million data points with some simple tags.
